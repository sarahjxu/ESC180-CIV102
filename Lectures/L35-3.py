# monte carlo integration
# throw dots onto a coordinate plane: profile of square, semicircle. number of dots proportional to area of semicircle
# computing the integral from 0 to 1 of sqrt(1-x^2)

# for any graph, how to figure out area?
# draw rectangle envelope over graph of interest
# throw dots onto the graph
# compute proportion of dots within the graph vs dots total, x area of rectangle
